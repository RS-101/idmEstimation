Description: Provides maximum likelihood estimation methods for
    illness-death models with interval-censored illness times and
    right-censored death times. Implements non-parametric maximum
    likelihood estimation (NPMLE), piecewise-constant hazards, and
    penalized spline-based hazard estimation. Includes simulation tools
    for generating data from illness-death processes with various
    censoring mechanisms. Methods are based on the EM algorithm and
    penalized likelihood approaches suitable for complex multi-state data.
