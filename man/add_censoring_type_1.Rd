\title{Add Interval Censoring to Exact Illness-Death Data}
\usage{
add_censoring_type_1(
  exact_idm,
  mean_time_between_visits,
  sd_time_between_visits,
  probability_of_right_censoring,
  prob_censoring_at_last_visit
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exact_idm}{Data frame with class \code{"exact_idm"} from
\code{\link{simulate_exact_idm}}, containing true event times.}

\item{mean_time_between_visits}{Numeric. Average time between visits}

\item{sd_time_between_visits}{Numeric. sd of time between visits}

\item{probability_of_right_censoring}{Numeric. Probability of right censoring by uniform variable on 0 to T_obs}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{obs}{Data frame with observed (censored) data containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: Subject ID
\item \code{V_healthy}: Last visit when observed healthy
\item \code{V_ill}: First visit when illness observed (NA if never observed)
\item \code{T_obs}: Observation/censoring time
\item \code{status_dead}: Indicator for observed death (1) or censoring (0)
\item \code{status_ill}: Indicator for observed illness (1) or not (0)
\item \code{case}: Factor classifying observation pattern (A-F)
}}
\item{cens_mechanism}{Data frame with censoring mechanism details including
observation schedules and censoring times.}
}
}
\description{
Each subject has a visiting scheme generated by a Gamma distribution with shape
and scale parameters derived from the mean and standard deviation of time
between visits. Right censoring is sampled with a binomial with
probability_of_right_censoring. For right censored subjects, the censoring time
is drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and T_obs.
}
\details{
Six observation cases are defined:
\itemize{
\item Case A: Illness and death both observed
\item Case B: Illness observed, censored while ill
\item Case C: Death observed, healthy at last visit before death
\item Case D: Censored, healthy at last visit
\item Case E: Death observed, unknown if healthy or ill (missing transition)
\item Case F: Censored, unknown if healthy or ill (missing transition)
}
}
