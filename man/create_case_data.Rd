\title{Classify Observed Data into Six Case Types}
\usage{
create_case_data(obs_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs_data}{Data frame with observed illness-death data containing:
\describe{
\item{V_0}{Baseline time (typically 0)}
\item{V_healthy}{Last visit when observed healthy}
\item{V_ill}{First visit when illness observed (NA if not observed)}
\item{T_obs}{Observation or censoring time}
\item{status_dead}{Death indicator (1 = dead, 0 = censored)}
\item{status_ill}{Illness observation indicator (1 = observed, 0 = not)}
}}
}
\value{
A named list with up to six components (\code{case_A} through \code{case_F}),
where each case is a list containing the relevant time variables for subjects
in that case:
\describe{
\item{case_A}{Illness and death both observed: needs \code{V_healthy}, \code{V_ill}, \code{T_obs}}
\item{case_B}{Illness observed, censored while ill: needs \code{V_healthy}, \code{V_ill}, \code{T_obs}}
\item{case_C}{Death observed, healthy at death: needs \code{T_obs}}
\item{case_D}{Censored, healthy at censoring: needs \code{T_obs}}
\item{case_E}{Death observed, unknown state: needs \code{V_healthy}, \code{T_obs}}
\item{case_F}{Censored, unknown state: needs \code{V_healthy}, \code{T_obs}}
}
}
\description{
Partitions illness-death model observations into six mutually exclusive cases
based on whether illness and death are observed, facilitating likelihood computation.
}
\details{
The six cases represent different censoring patterns:
\itemize{
\item Cases A & B: Illness is interval-censored between \code{V_healthy} and \code{V_ill}
\item Cases C & D: Last visit coincides with observation time (no missing data)
\item Cases E & F: Time gap between last visit and observation (missing transition)
}

This classification is essential for computing the likelihood, as each case
contributes different terms.
